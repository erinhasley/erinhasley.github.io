	<h2>About Encaustic</h2>

		<p>The word <i>encaustic</i> derives from Greek and means <i>burn in</i>. The technique involves the use of melted wax—usually beeswax—and heat. Damar resin, which is from the sap of fir trees in Southeast Asia, can be added to the wax to harden it, and the melted wax can be coloured by the addition of oil paint or pigment. The wax is applied in layers. Each layer is fused to the preceding one by using a tool such as an iron, a heat gun, a propane torch or a heated stylus. The layers can be built up by using a brush or pallet knife, by pouring or spattering. The hardened wax can then be scraped back or etched with pointed implements. Found objects or collage items are sometimes incorporated. One-of-a-kind prints can be produced by melting wax on a heated surface and then applying paper to pick up the wax. This process can be repeated in order to build up layers on the paper.</p>
		
		<p>The encaustic techniques used by artists today originated in ancient Greece where melted wax was applied as a waterproof coating on ships’ hulls.  As time went on, pigments were added to the wax in order to produce decoration on the ships. The technique was adopted by artisans in Greece, Rome and Egypt. Encaustic portraits that have survived from ancient times still appear lustrous and colourful.</p> 
	
		<p>Even though this is an enduring medium, works in encaustic should not be subjected to extremes of heat or below freezing temperatures.  The wax surface may be buffed with a soft cloth. </p>

<h3>Colours of the Bay: Encaustic Works Inspired by the Skies over Southern Georgian Bay</h3>	

		<p>It seems as if I have always had a passion for making things. As a child, I developed the habit of reading about craft techniques and then experimenting until I could produce satisfactory results. Eventually, I became interested in printmaking and worked with woodblock, silkscreen and white line techniques. For several years, papermaking became my primary artistic interest. More recently, I learned about acrylics and creative uses of paper at the Avenue Road School of Art and was introduced to encaustic techniques at the Art Barn in Toronto. After each of these learning opportunities, I was inspired to take up my old habits of reading and experimenting.</p> 

		<p>Working in encaustic appeals to me because it allows me to express a connection with the natural environment. It can be a very unpredictable medium, but I find the element of surprise intriguing. The finished product contains a germ of the original idea, but is a unique work.</p> 

		<p>My family has a cottage at Nottawaga Beach—on the east side of southern Georgian Bay across from Blue Mountain. For over a decade, I have documented the ever-changing nature of the sky over the Bay by taking digital photos of the legendary sunsets, the delicate winter mornings, the approach and aftermath of storms, the exchange of light and shadow, and the interplay between the sun or the moon and the cloud formations. The colours of the sky are remarkable—changing from month to month, from day to day, and sometimes from moment to moment. From May to October, whenever the water is calm enough, I row on the Bay. This activity gives me the chance to see the broad expanse of the sky, and I have witnessed some remarkable transformations while out on the water.</p> 

		<p>Some of the encaustic works in this show capture the colour of the sky at a specific point in time; others convey the feeling of the atmosphere and offer a more panoramic view.

<h3>Water Changes; Water Changes Everything</h3>

		<p>Living near the Great Lakes has given me the opportunity to really pay attention to how water changes. It is transformed into waves, foam, mist, ice, snow and cloud; it takes on an array of colours–blue, black, orange, purple, brown, yellow, aqua, green; it sparkles in the sun; it can be still, full of motion, or turbulent. The Great Lakes phenomenon of lake effect cloud and snow offers visual surprises.</p>

		<p>For two decades, I have been taking digital photos in order to document the changes that take place in and over Lake Ontario and the Southern Georgian Bay section of Lake Huron. I have tried to record the ever-changing nature of the water and skies, the impact on water of wind, of sunlight and moonlight, of legendary sunsets, of the approach and aftermath of storms. Water as cloud, and water as ice and snow present endless variations.</p> 

		<p>The photographs offer inspiration, but the final works are unique images. Like water, encaustic medium is mercurial and unpredictable.  Melted wax seems to have a life of its own, and I have learned to respect that and follow its lead.</p> 

		<p>In 1992, I became an <a href=https://www.evergreen.ca/> Evergreen</a> volunteer. One of the projects at that time involved planting thousands of native trees and shrubs along the Don and Humber Rivers in order to improve water quality. Given my connection with Evergreen, it seems particularly fitting that this show is at the Evergreen Brickworks and is so close to the Don River.</p> 

		<p>The works are a tribute to the importance of water at a time when the connection between climate change and water is an ever-present concern. Water changes; water changes everything.</p>
