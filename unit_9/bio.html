			<p>It seems as if I have always had a passion for making things. As a child, I developed the habit of reading about craft techniques and then experimenting until I could produce satisfactory results. Eventually, I became interested in printmaking and worked with woodblock, silkscreen and white line techniques. For several years, papermaking became my primary artistic interest. More recently, I learned about acrylics and creative uses of paper at the <a href="http://www.avenueroadartsschool.com/"> Avenue Road School of Art</a> and was introduced to encaustic techniques at the <a href="http://artbarnschool.com/"> Art Barn</a> in Toronto. After each of these learning opportunities, I was inspired to take up my old habits of reading and experimenting.</p> 

			<br>

			<p>Working in encaustic appeals to me because it allows me to express a connection with the natural environment. It can be a very unpredictable medium, but I find the element of surprise intriguing. The finished product contains a germ of the original idea, but is a unique work.</p>
