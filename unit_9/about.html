		<!--<h2>About Encaustic</h2>-->

			<br>

			<p>The word <i>encaustic</i> derives from Greek and means <i>burn in</i>. The technique involves the use of melted wax—usually beeswax—and heat. Damar resin, which is from the sap of fir trees in Southeast Asia, can be added to the wax to harden it, and the melted wax can be coloured by the addition of oil paint or pigment. The wax is applied in layers. Each layer is fused to the preceding one by using a tool such as an iron, a heat gun, a propane torch or a heated stylus. The layers can be built up by using a brush or pallet knife, by pouring or spattering. The hardened wax can then be scraped back or etched with pointed implements. Found objects or collage items are sometimes incorporated. One-of-a-kind prints can be produced by melting wax on a heated surface and then applying paper to pick up the wax. This process can be repeated in order to build up layers on the paper.</p>

			<br>
		
			<p>The encaustic techniques used by artists today originated in ancient Greece where melted wax was applied as a waterproof coating on ships’ hulls. As time went on, pigments were added to the wax in order to produce decoration on the ships. The technique was adopted by artisans in Greece, Rome and Egypt. Encaustic portraits that have survived from ancient times still appear lustrous and colourful.</p> 

			<br>
	
			<p>Even though this is an enduring medium, works in encaustic should not be subjected to extremes of heat or below freezing temperatures. The wax surface may be buffed with a soft cloth. </p>
